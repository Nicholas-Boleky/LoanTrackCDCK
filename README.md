# LoanTrackCDCK
A quick SwiftUI loan tracking app using CoreData backed up by CloudKit.

### Goal:
My goal with this application was to explore if/how CoreData worked differently in SwiftUI. I also wanted to see how CloudKit integrated with CoreData. 

### What this project utilizes: 
* Passing data between veiws
* Setting relationships in CoreData
* Working with dynamic sections on a form
* Programatic math

### What I learned:
I have used CoreData/CloudKit in Swift UIKit, however this was my first time implimenting it with SwiftUI. It didnt feel that much different, hower wiring up CoreData and its sorting functions to the various UI controls feels a lot more streamlined in SwiftUI. I played with some math in this application and sorting different years of payments into seperate sections on a form. 

### What I hope to add
I have a couple features I think would go great on this app when I have time in the future. I want to add more UI options for sorting so the user can sort loans or payments by ascending/descending date, and I want to incorporate interest in my calculations for this program. As it is, its not very useful for following a mortgage or a car loan...
